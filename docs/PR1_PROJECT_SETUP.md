# PR #1: Project Boilerplate and Setup

## Overview

This PR establishes the foundational project structure and configuration for the Tao Watch service. It sets up the core project layout, development environment, Docker configuration, and basic FastAPI application structure.

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure

We've adopted a modular approach to organize the codebase:

```
tao_watch/
├── app/                   # Main application package
│   ├── api/               # API endpoints
│   ├── core/              # Core functionality (config, security)
│   ├── db/                # Database models and operations
│   ├── services/          # External services integration
│   └── tasks/             # Background tasks
├── tests/                 # Test suite
├── docker/                # Docker configuration
├── requirements/          # Dependency management
└── docs/                  # Project documentation
```

This structure follows best practices for FastAPI applications, separating concerns into different modules.

### Configuration Management

We use Pydantic's `BaseSettings` to manage configuration, which allows us to:
- Load settings from environment variables
- Provide type validation for settings
- Support `.env` files for local development

The configuration is set up to manage all required aspects of the application:
- Project metadata
- API settings
- Database connections
- Redis and caching
- Authentication
- Bittensor integration
- Celery for background tasks

### Logging System

We implemented a comprehensive logging system using `loguru`:
- Intercepts standard logging messages to provide a consistent logging interface
- Configurable log level via environment variables
- Structured logging with timestamps, levels, and source information
- Integration with FastAPI and other frameworks

### FastAPI Application

The FastAPI application is structured to:
- Use the latest async/await patterns with Python 3.11
- Implement the lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
- Support CORS configuration
- Provide health check endpoints
- Structured for easy router integration

### Docker Setup

The Docker configuration includes:
- Multi-stage builds for efficient image size
- Proper security practices (non-root user)
- Configuration for all services (FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Health checks for all services
- Volume management for persistent data
- Docker Compose for orchestration

### Testing Framework

The testing framework is set up with:
- Pytest for test execution
- Async test support for FastAPI endpoints
- Test fixtures for common resources
- Test client configuration

## Technical Decisions

### Python Version

We've chosen Python 3.11 for its performance improvements and support for the latest async/await features.

### Dependencies Management

Dependencies are split into three files:
- `base.txt`: Production dependencies
- `dev.txt`: Development tools and linters
- `test.txt`: Testing frameworks and utilities

This approach allows for lighter production containers while providing comprehensive development tools.

### Async First

All components are designed with asynchronous patterns in mind:
- FastAPI's async endpoints
- Async database connections with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Async Redis client
- Celery for background processing

### Security Considerations

Security is prioritized from the start:
- Environment variables for secrets
- Example .env file without actual secrets
- Non-root user in Docker
- Prepared for authentication in subsequent PRs

## Next Steps

Following this PR, we will focus on:
1. Implementing database and Redis infrastructure
2. Setting up authentication
3. Integrating Bittensor functionality
4. Implementing the core API endpoints

## Testing

Currently, we have basic tests for:
- Health check endpoint functionality

As we add more features, the test suite will be expanded to ensure comprehensive coverage.
